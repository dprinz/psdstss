PSD Slices To StyleSheet (converter)
====================================

Extract the Slices from a PSD File and create a CSS or LESS stylesheet class structure.

## Quickstart

For this quickstart you need the compiled jar file. You need to create this first.

1. save **psd** as **png** *in photoshop*
2. with console **go to** this **directory** with the psd and png file
3. from console type: **java -jar psdstss.jar -f css --html**
4. enjoy *(the styles are now in new created style-directory)*

## Usage

    psdstss [PSD-File]* [-f css|less] [-p class-prefix]

    You can use more PSD-Files or leave it and let the script scan for all
    PSD-Files in folder. From slices the <name> will be the <css-class>,
    the <target> will be the <css-file>, in <alt-tags> are the options.

      -f, --format    Set output format (css, less). Default: less
      -p, --prefix    Set the prefix of the classes. Default: sprite-
          --html      Create a html site for testing the sprites (in css mode only).
      -v, --verbose   Show information about files and parsing etc.

## Example

    psdstss sprite.psd -f less -p org-logo-
